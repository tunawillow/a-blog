### What I’m doing now
I’m a biomedical engineer at Columbia University. I'm struggling to figure my so-called passion, but I think it lies in STEM. Other than that, I'm Vice President of the Badminton Club. 

If you only read one thing, read this readme. It’s like documentation, but about me!

Some more seasonal content. My website isn’t sure if it’s a website or a blog. (All posts, RSS)

### What is this website?
Still trying to figure it out! I want it to be a collection of ideas or fun events that have occurred in my otherwise mundane life. I might put reflections on interesting conversations on this blog. 

### Research
I am part of the Ho Lab at Columbia Medical Center. We reconstruct proteins in the malaria parasite using cryoEM. 

Fun facts about this website.
