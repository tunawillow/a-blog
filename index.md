## Tuna Willow

### What?
I never realized that my gamer name was cryptic and absolutely balogney to other people. To me, it always made perfect sense - my last name means willow, and my first name kind of sounds like tuna. My mom also told me to "hide my identity" on the web - don't use your real name, never fill in your real birthday, and don't friend strangers. But of course I wanted to game, so I sat in front of the computer struggling to think of a username that was fun, memorable, but not my real name. For Chinese games, I always did a keyboard slam and picked out characters that I found beautiful or funny (ie. 预防针 for 弹弹堂), but one can't exactly do that with English. Hence, Tuna Willow. 

Because of ingrained habits, I once changed my college email name into tuna willow. This led to mass confusion between my professors (who struggled to find my homework) and the mail center workers (who still address me as Tuna). Friends also laugh at me with confusion when they see it. But oh well, I like it enough. 

So. Website. The blogs that look like raw HTML always appealed to me - you can tell that a person made it for themselves by themselves. I thought they were ugly af for the longest time, but now I want one of my own. At first I envisioned a private diary sort of thing. But websites are meant to be public. So, this website will be a collection of things that I am interested in and not ashamed for the public to find. Cheers. 

### Icebreakers
I happen to be a fan of icebreaker questions. Many hate them and find them dumb. I genuinely think icebreakers have the potential to lead to very interesting conversations.

1. Whose brain do you want to live in for a day?

* Someone who thinks in math. 

2. Is water wet? 

This one is getting a little old. 

### Books and shows and fandoms that I am dying to talk about 

1. 三体 The Three Body Problem

2. Haikyuu!!

3. 三十而已 Nothing but Thirty

4. Genshin Impact

5. The Vlogbrothers

6. Hunter x Hunter (maybe)


### People I admire

This list will contain some public figures and fictional characters, but it will mostly be people I know. For privacy reasons (they don't know I'm writing about them), names will be replaced with a noun that reminds me of them, and they/them pronouns will be used because I need to get better at that. These are people I aspire to be. 

1. Urn 

It's hard to think of Urn objectively. They were in my life before I brought them in. When Urn cares about someone, they do everything to put them first. They are patient, dedicated, and resolved even if the future is hazy and catastrophic. Now that I think about it, they remind me a little of 章北海 in terms of mental fortitude. Unlike 章北海, they are young - still growing up with child-like habits. 

2. Fish

Fish is an encyclopedia. They are a ball of stress at times, but they find a way to get things done, and they do it well. At the same time, they find a way to learn about the world and to contribute to the community. They would take their instrument and busk to earn money for AA charities; they can give an hour lecture about the intricacies of South Asian history that created the Indian cuisines we eat now; they can give late night therapy sessions. Fish is also a vibe - their laughter is contagious. 

3. Nutribullet

Nutribullet is hard-working, passionate super-person. They manage to do everything they want, and everything is meaningful to themselves and the community. They are also not afraid to strike up conversations and seek out opportunities, because they're driven by what they find meaningful. 

4. Scarf

I always wonder what goes on in Scarf's head. They don't like talking about their problems, but they always care about yours. They are afraid to add burden, so they do their best to do small things to benefit others. 

5. Boba

Boba reminds me of my mom. This means I'm sometimes annoyed at them, but they manage you because they care about your well-being (#asianparenting). I look at Boba and I just think their heart is yuge! How can someone care so much about everyone? How can someone always be concerned about the emotions of strangers? I find myself thinking that some people "don't deserve" it, but Boba proves me wrong. Humans deserve it. It's our biases that are wrong. 

6. Duck

Lmao I love Duck. Duck is chill, thoughtful, hilarious, blunt. I admire Duck's humor, drive, and creative writing skills. 

7. Milo

Milo is my deep conversation buddy. They recently described life to me in arrows. We ride small arrows of direction from place to place, and we search for a larger arrow that arcs through our life. They are cute, affirming, and honest. 


darn there are many more.
